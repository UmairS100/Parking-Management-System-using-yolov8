Smart Parking management system [Spot Sense AI] is an innovative solution designed to streamline parking management by leveraging cutting-edge technology. 

Through advanced camera systems, it enables seamless entry of vehicles into parking facilities while automatically detecting and recording their number plates. 
This information is then used to retrieve registered user details from the database, initiating the parking session with the start time. 
Additionally, Spot Sense AI sends real-time notifications to registered users via email, recommending available parking slots and facilitating pre-booking options.
Upon exiting the parking area, the system again utilizes number plate recognition to calculate the duration of the parked vehicle's stay. 

Charges are dynamically calculated based on the duration, ensuring fair pricing according to the time spent. 
Moreover, users have the flexibility to pre-book parking slots based on real-time availability updates, allowing them to secure their desired slots in advance.
